		This software is the largest digital distribution platform it was made by <span>Valve</span>. 
		It has several handy user functions along with a community market with items you will never own,
		It has a community with helpful and funny reviews on products. Steam even allows user created content
		to be easily shared on the Steam Workshop, did I mention it was made by <span>Valve?</span>
